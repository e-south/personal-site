title: 'Metabolic pathway control'
---

Given my interest in yeast bioengineering and bioproduction, and Mary Dunlop's bioproduction background (including a postdoc with Jay Keasling plus earlier work on biofuels and efflux pumps in her lab), I started the PhD deep in metabolic engineering literature.

That focus led to my first paper on limonene. We built a multi-input transcriptional circuit to tune expression across four mevalonate (MVA) submodules in E. coli and mapped which levers mattered most; in our setup, limonene titers were especially sensitive to HMGR and HMGS regulation. The work added to the growing list of strategies for coordinating multi-gene bioproduction pathways and nudged me to think about dynamic control - keeping pathways aligned with cell state over time.

In my second PhD summer, I served on the Engineering Biology Research Consortium Student and Postdoc Association (EBRC-SPA) board, which opened the door to a summer internship at LanzaTech. At the time, LanzaTech was a leading synthetic biology company focused on gas fermentation with Clostridium to produce biofuels and commodity chemicals. As a Synthetic Biology and Host Strain Engineering Intern, I contributed to genetic tools and gas-fermenting strains and helped establish experimental and computational workflows for pooled DNA library design, high-throughput screening, next-generation sequencing, and biosensor development. That experience grounded my metabolic engineering arc in real biomanufacturing constraints and closed the first chapter of my PhD story.
