title: 'PhD at Boston University'
---

Over time, it became clear that the best teams I’d come across were combining biology, engineering, and computation at a deep technical level. That blend motivated me to continue my training at Boston University, joining the Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry PhD program and working within the Biological Design Center. There I connected with Dr. Mary Dunlop, and our early conversations quickly converged on a shared enthusiasm for designing synthetic genetic circuits that don’t operate as orthogonal systems that simply reside in cells, but instead are built to sense and work with the host cell’s native regulatory machinery.
