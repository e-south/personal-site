title: 'PhD at Boston University'
---

To build the kinds of genetic systems I wanted to work on, I realized the leaders in this growing space were fluent in biology, engineering, and computing. That insight pushed me to continue my studies into a PhD at Boston University's Biological Design Center, where I could deepen all three. I found a home in Mary Dunlop's lab, which shares my interest in designing synthetic genetic circuits that interact with native signaling networks to steer cell behavior. This became the starting point for my PhD arc in metabolic engineering and bioproduction.
