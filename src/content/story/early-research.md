title: 'Early research'

My research career began as an undergrad doing field biology work, including a summer at a Temburong Jungle Outpost in Brunei with University of Brunei Darussalam students studying gibbons and microhylid frogs (shout out Dr. David McLeod). Back at James Madison University, I joined Dr. Chris Berndsen's biochemistry lab and learned to express and purify ubiquitin-like proteins from _E. coli_ using size-exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography. I later joined Dr. Kathlynn Brown's cancer biology group at SRI International's Center for Macromolecular Bioscience as a student associate. There, I helped maintain mammalian cell cultures and evaluated peptide drug candidates in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models using flow cytometry and Western blotting, with day-to-day mentorship from the great Dr. Michael McGuire.
