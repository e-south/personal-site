title: 'Early research'

My research career began as a biology major drawn to the outdoors. I lived at a Temburong Jungle outpost in Brunei, working with University of Brunei Darussalam students to survey gibbon populations and study microhylid frog skin secretions. Back at JMU, I joined Dr. Chris Berndsen's biochemistry lab and learned protein expression and purification by producing human ubiquitin in E. coli and applying classic chromatography workflows. As my interest in applied biotechnology grew, I became a student associate at SRI International's Center for Macromolecular Bioscience (Kathlynn Brown and Michael McGuire), working in mammalian tissue culture and analyzing peptide drug candidates aimed at non-small cell lung cancer. Those experiences pushed me toward biological design and set the stage for discovering synthetic biology.
