title: 'Molecular sequence design'

Since returning to Boston, I’ve focused the second half of my PhD on an idea that motivated me from the start, building genetic circuits that can interact with native gene regulation and steer adaptive responses. To get there, I’ve been developing new cloning methods, improving promoter design workflows, and testing where LLMs can add real value in biological sequence design. Stay tuned!
