title: 'Imperial / Crick training'
---

My MRes combined a series of taught modules with a nine-month research project carried out across Imperial and the Francis Crick Institute, advised by Dr. Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro and Dr. Markus Ralser. The coursework covered deterministic and probabilistic modeling, experimental and theoretical systems biology, and core synthetic biology methods. For my project, I built a lab automation-enabled co-culture screening platform and paired it with an R analysis pipeline to map cross-feeding interactions across an auxotrophic yeast knockout library. The screens identified strain pairs that grew poorly alone but showed synergistic growth together. I received Imperial’s Outstanding Student Award and graduated first in my class.
