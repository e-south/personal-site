title: 'Imperial / Crick training'
---

After earning my undergraduate degree, I pursued formal training in systems and synthetic biology at Imperial College London and the Francis Crick Institute. The MRes was structured around intensive modules (modeling, experimental and theoretical systems biology, and synthetic biology) followed by a nine-month research project. I built a high-throughput screening platform to identify synthetic yeast communities, combining robotics-driven co-culture assays with an R analysis pipeline to surface promising strain pairs from large datasets. The work revealed auxotroph pairs that struggled alone but showed synergistic growth together. I graduated with Distinction, earned Imperial's Outstanding Student award, and ranked first in my class.
