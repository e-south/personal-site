title: 'Stepping into synthetic biology'
---

In parallel with my SRI work, I discovered synthetic biology and started looking for ways to practice biological design. I collaborated with faculty to launch an iGEM-inspired course at JMU, then led a student team to design a mercury-sequestration system in E. coli for bioremediation. Building and teaching that course solidified my commitment to synthetic biology and earned me an "Excellence in Biotechnology Leadership" award. That momentum made me decide to properly explore the field by starting a Master of Research in Systems and Synthetic Biology at Imperial College London, which set up the more technical Imperial/Crick chapter that followed.
