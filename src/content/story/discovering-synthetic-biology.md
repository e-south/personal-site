title: 'Stepping into synthetic biology'
---

During a summer in the Berndsen lab, I was reading papers in the hallway over lunch when I first stumbled across the phrase “synthetic biology.” I got hooked and started looking for ways to practice biological design. The next semester, I collaborated with faculty to launch an iGEM-inspired course at JMU and led a student team to design a mercury sequestration system in _E. coli_ for bioremediation purposes. Helping build and teach the course reinforced my interest in bioengineering and earned me an Excellence in Biotechnology Leadership award. That momentum led me to pursue a Master of Research (MRes) in Systems and Synthetic Biology at Imperial College London.
