# Content editing rules

- Every entry must validate against the collection schema in src/content.config.ts.
- Dates must be ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) and reflect publish date.
- Slugs are stable: do not rename folders for existing posts/projects/papers unless you add redirects.
- Prefer concise summaries; homepage pulls items with featured: true.
- When adding external links (GitHub, papers), verify they resolve (no typos).
