## Summary

PhD Candidate at Boston University (Biological Design Center / Dunlop Lab) working at the intersection of systems, synthetic, and computational biology. I build experimental + computational workflows for genetic circuits, high-throughput assays, and sequence-to-expression modeling.

## Education

- **Boston University** — PhD Candidate, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry (MCBB), Boston, MA, USA (2020–present)  
  Advisor: Mary J. Dunlop. Thesis: “Molecular Sequence Design for Interfacing with Gene Regulatory Networks.”
- **Imperial College London** — MRes, Systems & Synthetic Biology (Distinction), London, UK (2018–2019)  
  Outstanding Student award; coursework across experimental & theoretical systems biology and synthetic biology. Advisors: Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro (primary), Markus Ralser. Thesis: “A Screening Platform to Identify Synthetic Microbial Communities.”
- **James Madison University** — B.S., Biotechnology (Magna Cum Laude, GPA 3.72), Harrisonburg, VA, USA (2014–2018)  
  President, Biotechnology Association; Executive board, Tri-Beta Biological Honor Society.

## Experience

- **Boston University — Biological Design Center** — PhD Candidate, Boston, MA, USA (2020–present)  
  Developing genetic circuits, high-throughput functional assays, and DNA sequence-to-expression models to steer cell physiology for synthetic biology applications.
- **LanzaTech — Synthetic Biology & Host Strain Engineering** — Engineering Biology Research Consortium Intern, Chicago, IL, USA (May–Aug 2022)  
  Contributed to genetic tool development for gas-fermenting strains. Helped establish experimental + computational workflows for pooled DNA libraries, high-throughput screening, NGS, and biosensors.
- **Imperial College London — Centre for Synthetic Biology (with The Francis Crick Institute)** — Postgraduate Researcher (MRes), London, UK (Aug 2018–Jul 2020)  
  Built a robotics-enabled, high-throughput wet-lab workflow to study metabolic cross-feeding in yeast; developed R pipelines to identify synergistic co-growth pairs (led to co-first authorship in Nat. Chem. Biol.).
- **Science Entrepreneur Club** — Outreach Manager, London, UK (Mar–Dec 2019)  
  Partner engagement, event execution, and digital content highlighting early-stage life-science startups.
- **SRI International — Center for Macromolecular Bioscience** — Student Associate, Shenandoah Valley, VA, USA (Jun 2017–Aug 2018)  
  Analyzed peptide drug-candidate internalization in mammalian cells (flow cytometry, Western blotting) and supported development of cell-type-specific cancer therapies.
- **James Madison University — School of Integrated Sciences** — Undergraduate Researcher (REU), Harrisonburg, VA, USA (2014–2017)  
  Characterized human Uba1 enzyme; purified ubiquitin-like proteins from E. coli (SEC, ion-exchange chromatography).
