Building on high-throughput synthetic promoter libraries, I pursued
sequence-to-expression models that predict regulatory behavior across
environmental contexts and propose new designs. By combining systematic
measurements with modern ML approaches, including ideas from genomic language
models, in an iterative active-learning loop, the workflow moves toward
specification-driven promoter design. The goal is practical,
condition-dependent control for genetic circuits, biomanufacturing, and emerging
cell and gene therapy applications.
