To tune isoprenoid flux for limonene biosynthesis, we built a four-input
transcriptional circuit in which small-molecule inducers independently regulate
orthogonal promoters. Using the _E. coli_ Marionette strain as the chassis, we
applied this system to adjust early MVA enzymes (AtoB, HMGS, HMGR) and run
combinatorial expression sweeps to map tradeoffs and support pathway
optimization.
